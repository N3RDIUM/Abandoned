# Abandoned
If you're starting off as a dev, PLEASE DO NOT DO WHAT I DID. Do not go off just coming up with "revolutionary" ideas and creating too many projects. You won't get anywhere. Do a few good projects you *really* wany to spend time on. That's all I have to say here. Many of the projects in this repo are not even started: just empty repos with a readme and a gitignore. So yeah.
