# CosmOS

## Prerequisites

 - A text editor such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
 - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for creating our build-environment.
 - [Qemu](https://www.qemu.org/) for emulating our operating system.
   - Remember to add Qemu to the path so that you can access it from your command-line. ([Windows instructions here](https://dev.to/whaleshark271/using-qemu-on-windows-10-home-edition-4062))

## RUN: windows
```
"./run.bat"
```

## Cleanup

Remove the build-evironment image:
 - `docker rmi myos-buildenv -f`
